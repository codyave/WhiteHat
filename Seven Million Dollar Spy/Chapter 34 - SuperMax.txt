Chapter 34: SuperMax

The debriefings were over.
The psychiatrist had his final meeting.
And in July 2002 Robert Hanssen was transferred to the SuperMax, the toughest prison in the federal system, where he began serving his life sentence.
He was now a number: 4855108.
His new world had shrunk to a 7.5x12ft cell, with thick bars and a steel door in the high security wing.
A concrete slab with a thin mattress served as his bed.
The tiny 4" window allowed only a view of the sky and the roof.
The SuperMax, technically, the Administrative Maximum Facility (or "ADX") in Florence, Colorado, housed the most violent and dangerous criminals in America: terrorists, serial murderers, mafia hitman, gang leaders, and drug cartel bosses.
The prison also held a handful of spies.
Among the notorious inmates sent there were Ted Kaszinski, the Unibomber, Ramsey Yussef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing who was later convicted of a plot to blow up a dozen airliners, Umar Faruq Abdul Matalub, the underwear bomber, and Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City Bomber, who was housed there before he was executed.
No one had ever escaped from the SuperMax.
All inmates in the high security unit are held in solitary confinement.
They live alone in single-person cells staggard so the inmates in many cases cannot have eye contact with each other.
A warden of the SuperMax called the prison "a clean version of hell".
Hanssen was first imprisoned in the SuperMax for 23 hours per day.
He was allowed an hour a day to exercise.
Since then, some of the prison's rules have changed, and Hanssen was able to get out of his cell four hours a day on weekdays, and two hours a day on weekends.
He could use that time to exercise, read, shower, or a combination of those.
Like its prisoners, the ADX is isolated, located 180 miles due south in the barren foothills of the Rockies.
it was opened in 1994 and can house up
to 490 inmates 1400
electronically-controlled gates clang
shut to seal off the units watchtowers
ring the facility and there are laser
beams and sensors to detect any movement
in the area between the prison walls and
the razor wire ringing the perimeter
when prisoners are allowed out to
exercise Christopher B sins vol the
prisoners supervising attorney said
inmates are taken out one at a time in
shackles and escorted by guards to a
small wire cage some exercise cages are
inside the prison walls others outside
like other high-security prisoners
Hansen can exercise by himself or in a
group what it looks like is an outdoor
batting cage since fall said he is
escorted by officers placed in the pen
and restraints removed in the cage he
said prisoners can run do push-ups and
sit-ups Hansen cannot walk or run very
far the cage is small although about
double the size of his cell inmates eat
in their cells meals are brought to them
and handed to them through a food slot
Todd Chapman a public information
officer at the prison said that every
cell has a television we control what
channels they see they can view all the
major broadcast networks and cable but
no HBO that is because the Supermax
controls what films prisoners can watch
and no r-rated movies are allowed if
Hanson thought he might be able to use
his considerable computer skills at the
Supermax he was greatly disappointed at
ADX no inmates have access to computers
Chapman said the exception is the law
library which has computers that are
only able to search legal statutes which
are online should he ever be transferred
to a less severe prison computer access
would be up to the warden even if
granted he would never be allowed online
the FBI does not want Robert Hanson ever
again to be
be able to communicate with Moscow
unlike most prisoners at the Supermax
Hansen from the start was placed under a
draconian restriction known as special
administrative measure or Sam the Sam is
imposed by the
the United States Attorney General for
one year but may be renewed and extended
indefinitely
it was after 15 years Hansen was still
under a Sam the Sam meant he was cut off
almost completely from the outside world
under the provisions of the Sam Hansen
could not have contact with anyone other
than his wife members of his immediate
family his priests and his attorney I
discovered this when I attempted to send
a letter to Hansen seeking an interview
in return I received a stern letter from
the then warden Robert a hood informing
me that at the direction of the Attorney
General the special restrictions on
Hansen prohibited him from contact with
the news media because there was a
substantial risk of disclosure of
secrets that would pose a threat to the
national security of the United States
Hansen was also prohibited from
receiving mail or writing to anyone
except his family and his lawyer
Hansen's family had hoped he would be
sent to Allenwood the federal prison in
central Pennsylvania where he could be
visited more often since it is much
closer to them but the Bureau of Prisons
decided to send him instead to the grim
Supermax perhaps the government thought
he deserved an extra measure of
punishment or counterintelligence
officials worried that even locked down
alone in a maximum-security prison cell
he might somehow devise a way to slip
more secrets to the KGB
soon after Hansen arrived in the prison
in Florence Colorado bonny Hansen
accompanied by her daughter Susan and
Hansen's frail 90 year old mother Vivian
visited him no physical contact with
Hansen was permitted they spoke to him
by telephone through thick glass he
described to them the harsh conditions
in the Supermax he complained he was
developing hip trouble from sleeping on
the concrete slab this is really hard
time Hansen said at first
Hansen received visits from a Greek
Orthodox priest who provided him with
some books by CS Lewis later at Bonnie's
request a young Catholic priest was
allowed to see Hansen
most convicts are sent to the Supermax
for at least three years in the second
year some are rewarded for good behavior
by having a few restrictions removed
they may be allowed out of their cells
for group meetings in the third year
according to sins vol they can walk with
escort to the commissary the prison
store and can go to group meals but none
of that gradual easing of restrictions
in the three-year steps would be
possible for Hanson as long as the
attorney-general's sam remained in place
the only work that might be available to
Hanson in the Supermax would be a menial
prison job according to Chapman jobs are
unit orderlies sweeping mopping cleaning
scrubbing - Bonnie Hanson what her
husband did remained a deep mystery how
such a loving husband and father could
have done all this to Bonnie as she told
her family there was something so
utterly strange and tragic about the
whole thing
it was beyond her understanding but one
complaint he voiced to his family was an
indication of how after all that had
happened he had not fully grasped the
enormity of what he had done and the
cold reality of where he was I had
thought Hanson said that I might be
treated better in prison because of my
long years of service that was pure
fantasy by Hanson apparently he could
not face the fact that for almost 22 of
his 25 years in the FBI
he had intermittently betrayed the
country he had sworn to protect
when Hanson was an FBI
counterintelligence agent he might have
viewed a video of the arrest of Dmitri
Fedorovich Poliakoff top hat the first
and most valuable agent he betrayed to
the Russians the video had made its way
to the west and was even aired on CNN
it showed general Polyakov his arms
handcuffed behind his back as KGB goons
rip off his shirt fingers appear on each
side of his face forcing him to look at
the camera dignified despite all of this
top hat stares straight ahead
knowing full well that when the long
months of interrogation are over he will
be executed he never knew the name of
his betrayer
