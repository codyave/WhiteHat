Steele: "We can't allow our guy to be forced to go back home. It would be disastrous all round, though his position right now looks stable." (11:12am EST)
"our guy" is Evgeny Buryakov, a Russian spy who was set up by Carter Page in coordination with FBI counterintelligence.
By late January, Bruce Ohr and Chris Steele both had still not seen evidence to suggest that Carter Page was not acting as a foreign agent of Russia for the Trump campaign (stolen 702's wouldn't reveal Carter Page's true work). 
They are motivated to keeping Buryakov in the U.S. so that he may later testify against Carter Page.

Warner: "Just tried to call but now going into skif" (4:02pm EST)
Senator Mark Warner enters SCIF containing Carter Page's unredacted FISA.
FISA should indicate that Carter Page was acting as an American intel asset, not Russian.
Buryakov's presence in the U.S. now becomes a threat to the credibility of Crossfire Hurricane.
Carter Page will be exonerated if Buryakov is compelled to testify.
Big "oh shit" moment. 
Buryakov has to go, or the jig is up.

Waldman: "Deripaska is in London Monday-Thursday and I might be able to arrange a mtg w him too if you wish. I discusssed it with him today and he seemed interested." (2:28pm EST)
Oleg Deripaska will be in London from March 27th to March 30th.

March 26th, 2017
Waldman: "I have an idea to explore w you. Plus call when you're free." (7:04pm EST)
Deripaska, Waldman, Steele, Ohr, and Warner begin formulating an action plan to secure the early release of Evgeny Buryakov.

@20Committee: "TheHill: Senate committee to question Kushner over Russian meetings" (8:44am EST)
In a follow-up tweet, Schindler explicitly references Evgeny Buryakov, the convicted Russian spy.
A twitter search for "Buryakov" reveals that the most recent tweet prior to Schindler's that mentions Buryakov was submitted March 17th, 2017.

Within 45min of Schindler's tweet, about a dozen small accounts begin tweeting to various journalists, suggesting that Buryakov might be getting released from prison on Saturday, April 1st, 2017.
There are about 30 tweets in all, and the last one was posted on March 28th, 2017 at 3:27pm PST.

Waldman: "Update re the other other guy, my contact at DOJ has gone silent last 72 hrs. I gave him what he asked for and now don't hear from him. Please let me know if you hear anything. Will keep trying until I sense there is no appetite on either side for resolution. Interestingly just heard from DOJ that they received and are considering." (3:53pm EST)
Waldman (likely on behalf of Deripaska) seems to have given something very valuable on or around March 28th to his contact at DOJ, who then later gave it to someone else at DOJ.
Did someone at the DOJ tell Waldman's contact that they were considering the deportation of Buryakov in exchange for what (or who?) was just given to them?
