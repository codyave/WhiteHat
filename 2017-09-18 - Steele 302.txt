[CHS = Adam Waldman; sub source = Viktor Bitner ??]

The Attorney General's Guidelines dated 12/13/2006 require that the payment of any FBI funds to a CHS be made by an FBI Agent and another government official.
However, in extraordinary circumstances, the SAC is authorized to approve an exemption to this requirement.
This allows the FBI Agent to be the payer and only witness.

Is SAC approval for an emption to the second witness requirement requested for this payment?

From the end of June 2015 through November 2015, the CHS engaged a sub source at the FBI's direction to organize and facilitate meetings in Berlin, Germany between FBI WMDD components and an individual with  knowledge of the Government of Russia's bio weaponization efforts.
From the outset, the CHS identified the sub source to the FBI, who in turn identified the sub source to German authorities and CoS.
All of whom approved of the sub source's efforts to facilitate a meeting.
The sub source, whose contact was limited to the CHS, endeavored to do so and set meetings twice (September and November).
However, on both occasions at no fault tot he CHS or the sub source, the FBI (WMDD) cancelled at the last minute and the meeting was never conducted.
Despite this, the CHS and sub source continue to be willing to facilitate a meeting.
Attached is a bill date January 25, 2016, that was submitted to the CHS by the sub source for his services (meetings, briefings, reports, travel accomodations, meals) for 5000.00 Euro.
302's/1023's regarding the the matter are documented in the file as are emails between Legat Rome, Legat Berlin.
WMDD evidencing the planning and ultimate cancellation of the meetings.
Payment will be made to the CHS to reimburse expenses paid to the sub source in this regard.
