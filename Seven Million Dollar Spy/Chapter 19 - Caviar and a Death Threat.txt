Rochford said he knew a great place
nearby for dinner when they made
arrangements to meet scherbakov asked if
Rochford minded if he brought someone
else along sure anyone you want Rochford
said it will probably be the Security
Director of the UN mission the Russian
said but scherbakov seemed to have
thought better of his earlier threat to
report the FBI approach to the UN
mission he showed up alone and he had a
lot to drink
Rochford said the Russian was knocking
back great quantities of Tullamore do
the blended Irish whiskey Rochford
favoured he had a lobster at dinner he
got angry again and started swearing and
complaining about Gorbachev the Muslims
will become terrorists without the
Russians to hold him in check I was
agreeing with him whatever he said the
Soviet system is great from a purely
ideological point of view you're right
we did breakfast lunch and dinner for
the next week and a half we talked about
our families we had steps forward and
steps back
still the Russian had not offered any
clue about a KGB source inside American
intelligence but he confided startling
information about something else it was
after that first night when they met
again that the Russian revealed he was
under a death threat he was working for
the Irkutsk mafia he said and they had
arranged a caviar shipment to New York
worth a million dollars
but the caviar had spoiled enroute he
was the middleman and the Russian
mobsters blamed him he owed them
hundreds of thousands of dollars they
warned pay us the money they told him or
we will kill you
